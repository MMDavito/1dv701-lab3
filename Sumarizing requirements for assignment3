Only implementing Byte(octet) mode
Viewing all trafic as stream of bytes.

2 byte opcodes:(LIST::)
::

5 types of packets:
Read and write from client (1&2)
The 

Block number is used by the receving end to aknowledge the most (3)
recently receieved valid packet of data.

The error packet is sent when an error occurs and it contains both an error code and an error message(suggested)
That provides additional details.
(4)

and finaly datapakcet???

each packet has a size between 0 and 512 bytes, if <512 bytes it is the last packet??
rfc1350(summary from 
https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1350.txt
):
---------------------------------------
Request for read/write also serves as request for connection.
Server eighter 
Sends data and recieves acks
OR 
Sends acks and recieves data

3 types of error events causing termination of connection:
Not able to satisfy
Receiving file not expected
Cock blocked

1 ErrorType not suicide:
 Source port incorrect.
This causes reciver to return error package to sender(host?)
-------
3: Relation to other protocols:
IT IS UDP and builds ontop of UDP

------------------------------
WRQ is write request
RRQ is read request

On read datablocks will be sent with an index, starting from 0.
These are acked with reference to this index
On write request an ack with block number 0 will be sent
If reply is error message, request is denied

Page 4 spec...

-----
opcodes:
1	RRQ
2	WRQ
3	DATA
4	ACK
5	ERROR

Zero ending before ending to be ignored (invalid mode)

Filenames in ascii
No spaces eller åäö

Header is NetAscii
Data is eighter netascii or octet
Mode is .tolowercase

Quest: error: only allow netascii, else error?
No, client error not handled
TID är portnamnet

Data only need to bee implemented supporting octet (byte)
header always netascii
